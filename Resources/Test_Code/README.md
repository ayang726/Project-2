# Project Test Code

This is the project test code sandbox. Just some code I tested prior to the official start of the project.

In this folder you have access to the API keys and a small interface to use it.

* Use parseTestUrl to request Test data from iexcloud.io
* Use parseProdUrl to request Production data from iexcloud.io
